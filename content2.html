          <h4 class=content-title>Skate Videos: Rolling in a City Symphony</h4>
          <p class=date>Dominique Teoh  |  3 November 2020</p>
          <h5><br>
            Skateboarding is an urban offspring, the concrete cousin to surfing. The beauty of it is that it’s situational; it’s not just what you do but where you do it, and not knowing whether you’ll be greeted with a high-five or a slap on the face. Cities are to skateboarding what legs are to pants, and it only makes sense that skate videos pay respect to the concrete jungles they play in.

            <br><br>While skate videos are unique, the celebration of urban life is not; a notable example being the iconic city symphonies of the 1920s. These experimental documentaries captured the life of a city. With no characters or plot, the movements of these films took inspiration from musical symphonies.

            <br><br>Films like <i>Berlin: Symphony of a Great City</i> celebrated modern society. Others, like <i>À propos de Nice</i>, critiqued it, contrasting images of the working class with capitalist hedonism.

            </h5>

            <br><div class="caption"><i>Revolution? Boring.</i> Jean Vigo contrasts bourgeois idleness with working class labour in <i>À propos de Nice</i>.</div>


            <br><br><h4><strong>Social Inequality</strong></h4>
            <h5><br>Though unintentional, skate videos also draw attention to social inequality. Whether it’s the random passerby or the homeless homie, skate videos acknowledge the existence of society’s “lower” strata — marginal characters often omitted from mainstream media, except in depictions of poverty and marginalisation.

            <br><br>To be fair, skate videos often include these characters for their weird factor; but they aren’t judged or diminished for it. Skateboarders, too, are regular kooks, and skateboarding itself a celebration of weirdness. More often than not, the only characters castigated by skate videos are those in positions of authority — police, security guards, property owners  — a reflection of skateboarding’s anti-establishment cliché.

            <br><br>To equate skateboarding with a fight for equality is straight silly. Skaters can cross the line, disrespecting decent people beyond reason. All this lofty mumbo-jumbo is a side product and not the intention of skateboarding; but it does reveal the way public spaces are designed to <a href="https://urbanpolicy.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Howell_2001_Poetics-of-Security_NoPix.pdf" target="_blank"><u>benefit certain groups of people and actively exclude others</u></a>. <br><br>Street skating draws attention to defensive design, parodying these exclusionary efforts by creatively overcoming them. It’s one thing for urban designers to defend against skateboarders, but what if they defend against the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeyLEe1T0yo&ab_channel=Vox" target="_blank"><u>homeless</u></a>, the elderly or other “undesirables”?

            </h5>
            <br><br><h4><strong>Capturing the Spirit of a City</strong></h4>
            <h5><br>Skate videos have become a meaningful way to think about urban design and identity. The average filmer might not think about these things, but there are certainly those who do.

            <br><br>If we’re talking about odes to cities, Phil Evans’ <a href="http://lodownmagazine.com/features/panoramic-series" target="_blank"><u>Panoramic Series</u></a> is a personal favourite, exploring European cities through the lens of skateboarding. Moving from spot to spot, you cruise the streets of London, travel on the Paris Metro and drive around Antwerp. You even get a sense of <a href="https://youtu.be/x-l3YgQMKao" target="_blank"><u>Manchester’s linguistic identity</u></a>, with random Mancunian speech accompanying skate clips.
            <br><br>Evans' videos are an experiment in the visual, the aural and the narrative, embodying skateboarding's creative spirit in both form and content. But they also capture the spirit of these cities from a street-level perspective.

            <br><br><h4><strong>Fisheye on the World</strong></h4>
            <h5><br>Those of us outside the US learn to recognise New York spots long before we can point to the city on a map. In the same way, you’ll know a Shanghai spot when you see one; and you come to appreciate Soviet architecture for peppering the Eastern Bloc with marble plazas.

            <br><br>Like movies and books, skate videos offer a window to the outside world. They contribute to the imagined spirit of a city; but with very different focal points. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/macbalife/?hl=en" target="_blank"><u>Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA)</u></a> is a revered spot, not for its Mirós, Klees or Duchamps, but for its ledges and gaps.
            <br><br>It raises the question of what holds value in society — million-dollar objects that you aren’t allowed to touch or slabs of concrete that are daily baptised by sweat? Skaters the world over make <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320445331_Handrails_steps_and_curbs_sacred_places_and_secular_pilgrimage_in_skateboarding" target="_blank"><u>pilgrimages</u></a> to MACBA, a living public space with as much cultural significance as the objects in the museum itself.
            <br><br>A friend from North Macedonia once visited Malaysia, and I took him to some local spots. Busloads of tourists were snapping pictures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamek_Mosque" target="_blank"><u>Kuala Lumpur's oldest mosque</u></a>, and this guy turns his back on it to take a picture of a bench. So which is more valuable? The bench was clearly constructed with the mosque in mind, providing the perfect view; but skateboarding uprooted the bench from its intended context, promoting it to a focal point in its own right.

            <br><p>London’s Southbank is one of many holy sites in skateboarding. Ghof captures its global importance in “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B1ySIkCBh6F/" target="_blank"><u>Connect the Dots</u></a>,” featuring an international crew of skaters and Fritildea's Southeast Asia-inspired track.</p>

            <br><br><h4><strong>Mental Mapping</strong></h4>
            <h5><br>Skateboarding <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spots.my/" target="_blank"><u>elevates mundane objects to cultural landmarks</u></a>. While tourists use museums and monuments to navigate a city, skateboarders use spots. Directions like, “head past the MoF ledges and turn right before the triple set,” might not make sense to the average person, but it certainly would to a local skate rat.

            <br><br>I’m throwing this hypothesis out into the world: skate videos create mental maps, albeit patchy ones. After seeing the same spots over and over in skate videos, you subconsciously develop a sense of how they fit into a city, even if you’ve never been there before.
            <br><br>This map only gets clearer when you see the same places represented in video games and movies, each new angle filling in more gaps. This only applies to frequently filmed cities, so it was noticeable enough when I visited Southbank and Santa Monica Pier. It’s your first time there, but you know turning left will take you to the triple set.

            </div>

            <h5>
            <br><br>City symphonies and skate videos are energetic montages of urban life, dynamic in movement both in front and behind the camera. Of course, skate videos aren’t city symphonies. There's no real basis to compare them. City symphonies take place in one city, while skate videos can span the globe. City symphonies follow the cycle of a day; skate videos follow the cycle of a trick.
            <br><br>Yet, they feel more complementary than opposite. If they share anything, it's a love of the City — the good and especially the sketchy. In the background of every skate video, emanating through the cutaways and B-roll, is a silent symphony. <strong>|</strong>

            <br><h5>Skateboarder and scholar Paul O’Connor wrote a great <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320445331_Handrails_steps_and_curbs_sacred_places_and_secular_pilgrimage_in_skateboarding" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> about skateboarding and secular pilgrimage, highlighting the role of skate videos in turning banal urban spaces into meaningful places.
            <br><br>I'll forever recommend Ocean Howell's <a href="https://urbanpolicy.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Howell_2001_Poetics-of-Security_NoPix.pdf" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> on skateboarding, surveillance and public space.
